Services:
Pet Inventory Service
Order Service
Payment Service
Notification Service
Kafka Topics:
orders: For placing and tracking orders.
payments: For processing and confirming payments.
notifications: For sending out notifications to users.
Pet Inventory Service
Manages pet information and inventory.

APIs:

GET /pets - List all available pets.
GET /pets/{id} - Get details of a specific pet.
POST /pets - Add a new pet (admin).
PUT /pets/{id} - Update pet details (admin).
DELETE /pets/{id} - Delete a pet from inventory (admin).
Kafka Integration:

Subscribes to orders topic to decrement inventory when an order is placed.
Order Service
Handles the creation and management of pet orders.

APIs:

POST /orders - Place a new order.
GET /orders/{orderId} - Retrieve order details.
GET /orders/user/{userId} - List orders by user.
Kafka Integration:

Produces messages to the orders topic when a new order is placed.
Consumes messages from the payments topic to update order status based on payment success or failure.
Payment Service
Processes payments for orders.

APIs:

POST /payments - Process payment for an order.
GET /payments/{paymentId} - Retrieve payment details.
Kafka Integration:

Consumes messages from the orders topic to initiate payment processing.
Produces messages to the payments topic to indicate payment success or failure.
Optionally, produces messages to the notifications topic to notify users about payment status.
Notification Service
Sends notifications to users about various events like order confirmation, payment status, etc.

APIs:

Internal API to send notifications based on events.
Kafka Integration:

Consumes messages from the payments and orders topics to send notifications related to payment and order statuses.
Architectural Considerations with Kafka
Scalability: Kafka is highly scalable, allowing you to easily scale your messaging system up or down based on the load, by adjusting the number of brokers or partitioning topics.
Fault Tolerance: Kafka's distributed nature ensures data is replicated across multiple nodes, making the system resilient to node failures.
Performance: Kafka is designed for high throughput and low latency messaging, which is essential for real-time applications like order processing and inventory management.
Event Sourcing: Kafka can act as the backbone for an event-sourced system, where every change to the application state is captured as a sequence of events.
This architecture leverages Kafka's strengths to facilitate asynchronous communication and event-driven interactions among microservices, making the system more scalable, resilient, and capable of handling high volumes of messages efficiently.

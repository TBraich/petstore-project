RabbitMQ Integration
RabbitMQ serves as the message broker to facilitate asynchronous communication between services. It helps to decouple services by allowing them to publish and subscribe to messages without being directly connected to each other.

Pet Inventory Service & Order Service: When an order is placed, the Order Service publishes an event that the Pet Inventory Service listens for to decrement the inventory.
Order Service & Payment Service: After validating the order, the Order Service sends an event to the Payment Service to process the payment.
Payment Service & Notification Service: Once the payment is processed, the Payment Service publishes a confirmation event that the Notification Service uses to notify the customer about the order and payment status.
This architecture allows for scalability, as each service can be scaled independently based on demand. Additionally, it enhances the system's resilience, as the failure of one service doesn't directly impact the others, and they can continue to operate or recover gracefully.
